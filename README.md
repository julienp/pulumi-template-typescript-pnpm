A pulumi template that uses pnpm to manage node dependencies.

Note that the presence of `pnpm-lock.yaml` is what makes `pulumi install` opt in to using pnpm over npm.

```
% pulumi new --stack dev \
    --name "pnpm-example" \
    --description "project using pnpm" \
    https://github.com/julienp/pulumi-template-typescript-pnpm
